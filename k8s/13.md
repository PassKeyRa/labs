We can see that there are different visit times in different pods. This is because the LoadBalancer decides by itself, where to pass the request going to the service to balance between replicas

Since replicas are executing independently, we do not need ordering guarantee here

StatefulSet controller terminates pods in parallel with option `podManagementPolicy: 'Parallel'` added to `statefulset.yaml`
